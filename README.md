# polish_text_interpreter
A python script that converts a text file with plain polish text written into polish text that includes all necessary special characters that are part of the polish language.

This program takes input in the form of txt file that contains some text written in polish 
and converts all characters ment to be some special character ['ą', 'ć', 'ę', 'ł', 'ń', 'm', 'ó', 'ś', 'ź' 'ż']
from the regular characters ['a', 'c', 'e', 'l', 'n', 'm', 'o', 's', 'z']

The script is still a work in progress and is more a proof of concept as I want to run a web application with a python backend to serve this program.
The hope is that polish speakers who need to regularly write in polish can simply use the converter tool instead of using cumbersome online keyboards and
writing tools to write correctly in polish.
